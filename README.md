I like building backend systems, developer tools, and AI-powered games.  
Currently into Rust, Go, and Web3.

Things I’m working on:

- **Lexy** - An Operating System made in Rust.
- **Maze Wizard** – Rust-based dungeon chase with evolving AI enemies.  
- **QuikBase** – Go-powered DB API service with schema automation and Docker support.

Curious by default. Shipping often.
