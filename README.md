I like building backend systems, developer tools, and AI-powered games.  
Currently into Rust, Go, and Web3.

Things I’m working on:

- **P2rent** - Basically Peer-to-peer decentralised, Micro Bit-torrent.
- **Kairo** – Static Site generator in Rust .  
- **Pido** – A CLI tool to compress PDFs,images and text files in Go.

Curious by default. Shipping often.
